# Next Steps - Complete Supabase Setup

## Current Status ‚úÖ

Your application is fully coded and running! The development server shows:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible at http://localhost:3002/dashboard
- ‚úÖ Documents page accessible at http://localhost:3002/dashboard/documents
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints created and functional
- ‚úÖ Theme toggle, sign out, and navigation working

## What You Need to Do Now üéØ

The only thing preventing the Documents page from working is that the Supabase database hasn't been configured yet. You'll see this error:

```
Failed to fetch documents
column documents.user_id does not exist
```

**This is expected!** You just need to run the database setup.

## Setup Instructions (5-10 minutes)

Follow the detailed instructions in **`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`**. Here's the quick version:

### Step 1: Create Database Table (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy ALL contents from `supabase/migrations/001_create_documents_schema.sql`
6. Paste and click **Run**
7. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket (2 minutes)

1. Click **Storage** in left sidebar
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Name: `documents`
4. Public bucket: **OFF** (keep private)
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies (3 minutes)

Click on the `documents` bucket ‚Üí **Policies** tab ‚Üí **New Policy**

Create these 3 policies:

**Policy 1: Upload**
- Name: `Users can upload their own documents`
- Operation: `INSERT`
- Target roles: `authenticated`
- Definition:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'documents'::text) AND (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1])
```

**Policy 2: Read**
- Name: `Users can read their own documents`
- Operation: `SELECT`
- Target roles: `authenticated`
- Definition:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'documents'::text) AND (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1])
```

**Policy 3: Delete**
- Name: `Users can delete their own documents`
- Operation: `DELETE`
- Target roles: `authenticated`
- Definition:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'documents'::text) AND (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1])
```

## Verify Setup Works

After completing the setup:

1. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3002/dashboard/documents
2. You should see "No documents yet" instead of an error
3. Upload a document via Flashcards or Chat mode
4. Check Documents page - your document should appear!
5. Click on document and select a learning mode
