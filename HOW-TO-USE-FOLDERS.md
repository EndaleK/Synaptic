## Tips and Tricks

1. **Name folders clearly**: Use descriptive names like "Biology 101 - Fall 2024" instead of just "Bio"

2. **Limit nesting depth**: Try to keep folders no more than 2-3 levels deep for easy navigation

3. **Use icons consistently**:
   - 📚 for subject folders
   - 📖 for chapter folders
   - 🎓 for course folders
   - 🔬 for lab/research folders

4. **Review regularly**: Clean up and reorganize folders at the end of each semester

5. **Archive old content**: Create an "Archive" folder for completed courses
