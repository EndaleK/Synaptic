# Examples of Good Feedback

## Example 1: Detailed Bug Report

**Feature:** Mind Map Generation

**Issue:** Mind map generation times out for documents over 30 pages

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Signed into dashboard
2. Clicked "Mind Maps" tile
3. Uploaded "Biology_Textbook_Chapter5.pdf" (45 pages)
4. Clicked "Generate Mind Map"
5. Waited 10 minutes - page showed "Generation Failed: Timeout"

**Expected behavior:** Mind map should generate successfully, or show progress indicator

**Actual behavior:** Failed with timeout error after ~10 minutes

**Priority:** üü° Important - Large documents are common for students

**Additional info:** Same document worked fine for flashcard generation. Tried on Chrome 118, MacBook Pro.

---

## Example 2: UX Suggestion

**Suggestion:** Add keyboard shortcuts for flashcard navigation

**Reason:** When reviewing 20+ flashcards, clicking arrows gets tedious. Would be great to use:
- Space bar: Flip card
- Left/Right arrows: Navigate between cards
- G key: Mark as "Got it"
- R key: Mark as "Needs review"

**Benefit:** Faster review process, more engaging for power users

---

## Example 3: Positive Feedback

**Feature:** Document Chat

**What worked well:**
- AI actually asks me questions instead of just giving answers - this is BRILLIANT!
- Felt like having a study buddy who knows the material
- Responses were accurate and relevant to my uploaded PDF
- Really helped me understand concepts I was struggling with

**Specific example:** Asked about photosynthesis, and instead of explaining, AI asked me "What do you think plants need to create energy?" - made me think through it myself.

**Improvement idea:** Maybe show a hint system if I'm really stuck?
