## 🎬 VEO 3 BEST PRACTICES

### Prompt Engineering Tips
1. **Be Specific About Style**: Reference real cinematographers, camera models, or visual styles (e.g., "Canon C300 look", "Apple commercial aesthetic")
2. **Describe Lighting**: Always specify lighting direction, color temperature, quality
3. **Camera Movement**: Explicitly state "static", "dolly", "push-in", "orbit", etc.
4. **Duration Precision**: Veo 3 performs best with 6-10 second segments
5. **Avoid Complex Physics**: Stick to smooth, simple motions rather than complex simulations
6. **UI Elements**: Describe text, buttons, colors clearly - Veo 3 can generate readable text

### What Veo 3 Excels At
- ✅ Smooth camera movements (dolly, orbit, push-in)
- ✅ Realistic human subjects and expressions
- ✅ UI/UX interface animations
- ✅ Lighting and atmosphere
- ✅ Particle effects and data visualizations
- ✅ Logo animations and typography
- ✅ Product shots with depth of field

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Complex character dialogue (lip-sync issues)
- ❌ Fast action sequences with physics
- ❌ More than 2-3 subjects in frame
- ❌ Long duration clips (>10s can drift from prompt)
- ❌ Extreme camera angles or fisheye effects
- ❌ Hand-held shaky cam (specify "smooth gimbal" if needed)

### Generation Strategy
1. **Generate Each Scene Separately**: Create 6-10 second clips individually
2. **A/B Test**: Generate 2-3 variations per scene and pick the best
3. **Consistency**: Use same style keywords across all scenes
4. **Iterate**: Regenerate with refined prompts if first attempt doesn't match
5. **Post-Production**: Combine clips in editing software (Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve)

---

## 🎞️ POST-PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Editing Timeline (Adobe Premiere Pro / DaVinci Resolve)

1. **Import Veo 3 Clips**: All generated scenes
2. **Arrange on Timeline**: Follow scene order from script
3. **Add Transitions**:
   - Crossfade (0.5-1s) between scenes
   - Smooth cuts on action
   - Avoid jarring jumps
4. **Color Grading**:
   - Apply consistent LUT (Rec.709 or custom)
   - Match exposure across scenes
   - Enhance blues/purples for brand consistency
5. **Add Screen Recordings**:
   - Record actual Synaptic.study UI for authenticity
   - Insert over Veo 3 backgrounds if needed
6. **Audio**:
   - Background music (Epidemic Sound, Artlist)
   - Voiceover (professional or AI voice - ElevenLabs)
   - Sound effects for UI interactions
7. **Text Overlays**:
   - Feature callouts
   - Statistics
   - URL and CTA
8. **Export**:
   - H.264 codec
   - 1080p or 4K
   - 8-10 Mbps bitrate
   - MP4 container

### Recommended Music Tracks (Royalty-Free)

**Epidemic Sound**:
- "In the Clear" by Luwaks (uplifting, modern)
- "Future" by Ason (tech, energetic)
- "Inspired" by Refeeld (motivational)

**Artlist**:
- "Digital Dreams" (electronic, positive)
- "New Horizons" (inspiring, corporate)
