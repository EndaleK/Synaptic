- Frame answers as questions that lead to understanding
- Instead of direct definitions, provide guiding questions
- Example - Instead of "Photosynthesis is...", use "What process allows plants to convert light into energy? Consider: What do plants need? What do they produce?"
- Encourage critical thinking and self-discovery
- Provide hints and leading questions rather than direct answers`,

      chat: `TEACHING METHOD: Socratic (Guided Discovery)
- NEVER provide direct answers immediately
- Respond to questions with thoughtful counter-questions
- Guide the user to discover answers through inquiry
- Ask "What do you think?" and "Why might that be?"
- Provide hints only when the user is stuck
- Validate reasoning process, not just correct answers
- Example: User asks "What is X?" â†’ You respond "Great question! Let's explore together. What do you already know about topics related to X? What patterns do you notice?"`,

      podcast: `TEACHING METHOD: Socratic (Guided Discovery)
- Structure as a dialogue with rhetorical questions
- Pose questions and guide the listener through reasoning
- Example: "You might be wondering, what causes this? Let's think about it step by step..."
- Build understanding progressively through inquiry
- Pause for reflection: "Before we continue, consider..."
- Guide discovery rather than lecture`,

      mindmap: `TEACHING METHOD: Socratic (Guided Discovery)
- Frame node content as guiding questions
- Instead of stating facts, pose inquiry prompts

- Include exploration prompts at each branch
- Encourage user to discover connections
- Use question-based labels for deeper nodes`
