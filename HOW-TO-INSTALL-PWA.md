## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Install" option doesn't appear

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Already installed** - Check your home screen or apps list
2. **Wrong browser** - iOS requires Safari, desktop works best in Chrome/Edge
3. **Not HTTPS** - PWAs require secure connection (synaptic.study uses HTTPS ✓)
4. **Cache issue** - Clear browser cache and revisit the site

### Installation failed

1. Clear browser cache
2. Close all tabs
3. Reopen browser
4. Visit `https://synaptic.study` in a new tab
5. Try again

### Icons have white background (old cache)

See `CLEAR-PWA-CACHE.md` for detailed instructions on clearing cache to see new transparent icons.
